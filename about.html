                        Welcome to <strong>Coffee Point</strong>, a family-owned and operated cafe that serves delicious coffee, tea, and baked goods. 
                        We are located in the heart of Quezon City, Philippines, and we are open from 7 am to 10 pm every day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our cafe was founded in 2023 by Coco, a coffee enthusiast and baker who wanted to share her passion with the community. 
                        She started by selling her homemade cakes and cookies at local markets, and soon gained a loyal following of customers who loved her treats.
                         With the help of her husband and two children, she decided to open her own cafe, where she could offer a wider variety of drinks and desserts.

                    <p class="feedback">What a great cafe! The service was fast and courteous, the menu was varied and appealing, and the quality was superb and consistent. I tried the cappuccino and the chocolate cake, and they were both divine. The cappuccino was frothy and rich, and the chocolate cake was decadent and moist. This is my new favorite spot for a coffee break.</p>
